<h1>Embedded Software</h1>
We are not typical C/C++ developers. We believe that only critical parts as drivers and libraries need to be written in low level language. We use wonderful micropython as a top layer enabling us to code and deliver quickly. If it comes to platforms. We can code most of microcontrollers available on market (such as RISC-V, ARM, STM32, ESP32).

<h1>Machine Vision</h1>
We successfully integrated well known brands (such as Keyence, Basler) for our clients, but we also have our own products that cover non standard requests in terms of algorithms, specs and pricing. We use opensource technologies which are flexible and we are often few steps ahead of big names in the industry.

<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
It is a real gamechanger in variety of situations including industrial tasks. We are getting better everyday. We train models which often overperform regular algorithms and open new ways of problem solving.

<h1>Machine Interfacing</h1>
We know your machines. We know how to exchange data between them. ABB, Fanuc, Kuka and PLC's are all covered.

<h1>Custom Electronics</h1>
Your custom needs often require custom designs. No problem for us. We provide full range of services in fields of PCB fabrication, electronic design etc.
