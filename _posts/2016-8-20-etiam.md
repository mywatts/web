Over the year period as Research Lab we got into Industrial Machine Vision.
We did many attempts to figure out what it is all about. Our natural first choice was RPI and OpenCV which resulted in our first prototype.
It was doing well, but it was big, power hungry and not enough stable to be used in the field.
We then tried several comercial cameras and systems (mostly Basler) to later decide to go for OpenMV.
We immediately fell in love with MicroPython which later resulted in other MP related projects.
What also is worth mentioning is Risc-V (K210) and things you can do with it. We still do not know its full potential.
We took OpenMV, designed custom enclosure which enabled us also to mount C/CS optics and did ethernet interface.
